# Tailwind CSS: Incorrect Content Path Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied due to an incorrect `content` path in the `tailwind.config.js` file.  This bug is particularly tricky because it can be difficult to trace if the paths aren't carefully reviewed.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when the `content` array in the Tailwind configuration does not accurately point to the directories and files containing your HTML and component files where Tailwind directives are used.  If the paths are wrong, Tailwind will not find and process the directives, resulting in missing styles.

## Solution

Ensure that the `content` array correctly includes all directories and file types where you use Tailwind CSS directives. Pay close attention to your project structure and adjust the globbing patterns accordingly.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
3. Attempt to view the application. Styles related to Tailwind directives will be missing.

## How to Fix the Bug

1. Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to correctly point to the locations of your HTML and component files.
2. Re-run your build or development server after making the changes.
